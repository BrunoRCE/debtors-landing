<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This privacy policy applies to the "Deudores" app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for

    Provider"). The Application is provided as a <strong>Freemium</strong> service. This service is
    provided "AS IS."</p>

<h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

<p>The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time with
    important information, required notices, or marketing promotions.</p>

<h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<p>The Application may also collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited
    to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile deviceâ€™s unique device ID, your IP address,
    your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information
    about how you use the Application.</p>

<h2>Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?</h2>
<p>This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile
    device.</p>

<h2>Is the information stored on a server?</h2>
<p>All data entered by the user is stored locally on the device and is not transmitted to any
    server, except for crash data and analytics as explained below.</p>

<h2>Deudores Pro Subscription</h2>
<p>The Application has a subscription option called <strong>Deudores Pro</strong>, which grants
    users additional features such as advanced graphs and the removal of ads. Even if the user
    subscribes to Deudores Pro, certain data may still be collected, such as crash reports and page
    views within the app, to improve the user experience and monitor the app's performance.</p>

<h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>
<p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help the
    Service Provider improve the Application and the service. The Service Provider may share your
    information with third parties in the ways described in this privacy statement.</p>

    employees and contractors who need it to operate, develop, or improve the Application. Please be
    aware that, although we strive to provide reasonable security for information we process and
    maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will
    notify you of any changes by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to
